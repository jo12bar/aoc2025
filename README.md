# Advent of Code 2025 - My solutions

Just my personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com)
challenges.

Don't expect much from this - the solutions probably won't be good, and I don't
know for sure if I'll finish every challenge.

This year, the goal is to have my solutions in Godot, since I want to learn
the engine. The plan is to write the solutions in GDScript and have some basic
"flash game level select"-style interface for running them. And _maybe_ some
visualizations if I have some time. Would be cool if I could (ab)use the scene
tree for solutions as well.

But, since I'm travelling right now and don't have Godot downloaded... for now
the first few solutions will be in Lua. And I'll definitely migrate them to
Godot some day. Totally. Probably. Maybe.
